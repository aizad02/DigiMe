Another nice pebble watchface

## My Intention
I wanted to have one code base for a pebble watch face which is easy to modify and open source. This is a collection of most of the pebble developer tutorials. It includes:
 * Get weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org)
 * Display battery status
 * Use of a font (for the moon phase)
 * Draw graphics (sun shine)
 * And of course diplay current time/date
  
I also thought about make some things configurable (like time format or temperature unit). But currently i don't like how it is implemented in pebble. You need to host an external website for this. I would need to create a dependency what i currently don't want. Perhaps later ... If you would like to have something different, feel free to post an feature request or just clone this project ...
